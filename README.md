# Description

A simple addon to resize the Class Hall/Garrison minimap button to be the same size as all the other buttons. Also moves the button to the NW part of the minimap.

# Limitations

* Only works with the default (circular) minimap. Would probably work with other minimap mods as long as they are circular, and not scaled differently than the default. I do not plan on supporting other map mods, as they usually have minimap button support built-in.
* Cannot move the button (unless you want to dig into the code, then by all means go right ahead!).

# Planned features

* Ability to move the button
* Ability to resize but not move the button
* Ability to move but not resize the button

# Thanks

* Special thanks to Spydir, who lamented that there wasn't a mod that did JUST this and so naturally I had to figure it out.
* Everyone who uses the default UI. Without you, I wouldn't be making mods!
